This code has mainly two separate functionalities. "main.py" and the scripts starting with "abq_XX.py" are the scripts to create the simulation data from the commercial software Abaqus. The functionality is divided into scripts of single functions, which are called into a main script which is executed. 
The code for training and testing the CNN with architecture and hyperparameters is found in a single script, which is cnnDO.py. The framework used is PyTorch. There are more complementary scripts to create plots, move files and loop the execution of scripts within bash-scripts.
